			Hi! I'm Gus, a 16 year old student at Queen Elizabeth High School, and this is my icebreaker project. 
			</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>
			To begin, I was born January 8th, 2003, in Santa Monica. As I was born in the U.S.A, and moved to Canada when I was 3, I'm a dual citizen. I enjoying reading, playing video games, watching plays & musicals, geeky things in general (I've been going to Calgary Comic-Con every year since I was 5), and in warmer weather I spend a lot of time longboarding or biking, this past summer I recieved my black belt in Taekwon-Do.
			One of my interests that transitioned from a job to a hobby is acting. My first ever time acting was when I was around 7 years old, in the documentary series <i>Pet Heroes</i>, which reenacted real life events of people's pets saving their lives. Since then I've had numerous voice acting roles, along with multiple on stage performances and on-screen roles.
			I pride on my (as described by outside sources) witty sense of humor, and creative thinking.

				This picture is of the exterior of <i>Another Dimension Comics</i>, a shop behind the Safeway on Kensington. This represents me because one of my main hobbies is reading comics, and I have a rather extensive collection. Another thing to add is this is my local comic shop, and I go there on a regular basis.
